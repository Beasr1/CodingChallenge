# Count Word Terminal Simulation

This project compiles series of both basic and complex challenges and projects to s single cli tool.

This is an ongoing project which I am regularly updating and having a lot of fun while doing so.

Thanks for visiting. If you find a error or something I can do better please feel free to ping me.

Folder structure is so mainntained to encapsulate my progression every challenge wise. Each challenge folder has complete cli tool having feature of previous challenges as well.

Currently working on python because I want to focus on challenge for now to get a hang of it.
Planning to replicate on either GO or RUST in future.
