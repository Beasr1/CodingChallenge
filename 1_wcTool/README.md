# Count Word Terminal Simulation

This challenge is to build your own version of the Unix command line tool wc!

The Unix command line tools are a great metaphor for good software engineering and they follow the Unix Philosophies of:

- Writing simple parts connected by clean interfaces each tool does just one thing and provides a simple CLI that handles text input from either files or file streams.
- Design programs to be connected to other programs - each tool can be easily connected to other tools to create incredibly powerful compositions.

  python ccwc.py
```

## Commands :

Terminal Simulation will run :

ccwc :

```bash
> ccwc -c test.txt
> ccwc -l test.txt
> ccwc -w test.txt
> ccwc -m test.txt
```

exit :

```bash
> exit
```

help :

```bash
> help
```

- `-w` : Prints the number of words in the file.
- `-c` : Prints the number of bytes in the file.
- `-m` : Prints the number of characters in a file. If the current locale does not support multibyte characters this will match the -c option
